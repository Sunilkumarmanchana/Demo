    "Conclusion\n",
    "The stakeholder's problem is resolved. Stakeholder wants to find the best place to build a new cinema in Hong Kong, and the factors of \"best location\" is based on the number of venues in eating, shopping, transportation category around the location. Stakeholder also provide his favourite list of cinema to further explain what the \"best location\" is. Content-based filtering machine learning technique is the most suitable method to resolve the problem. It combines stakeholder's preference and cinema profile to make the recommendation result.\n",
    "\n",
    "The 5 target locations of new cinema may not be a good choice. As the weighting matrix is developed, I can quickly pick other locations and make the recommendation again."
